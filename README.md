# Turtle-Crossing-Game
 Turtle crossing game with python

This is simple Turtle crossing game implemented in python. There are 4 .py files in the file. These are respectively;   

**player.py:** We create our turtle and with the function we created, we make it go forward when the command comes.  

**rectangles.py:** We create random rectangles on the right side of the screen and move each of these rectangles along the x-axis.   

**scoreboard.py:** With this file that controls the level, level 1 increases every time the turtle crosses.  

**main.py:**  It is our main file. Objects are created in it, controls are provided and functions are called.    

The turtle trying to cross the street tries to reach the opposite point successfully without hitting the vehicles. If the turtle crosses, our level will increase by one and the speed of the vehicles will accelerate. If the turtle hits one of the vehicles, it's game over.
